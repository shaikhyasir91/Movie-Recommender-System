# Movie-Recommender-System

This is a movie recommender system that uses machine learning to recommend movies to users based on the same actor or genre as the movies that they have rated in the past. The system is trained on a large dataset of movie ratings, movie genres, and actor casts. Once trained, the system is deployed as a Streamlit web app.
